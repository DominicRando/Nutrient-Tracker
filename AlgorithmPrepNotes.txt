Main Factors That Determine Daily Nutrient and Caloric Needs:
    1. Age
    2. Sex (Male/Female)
    3. Weight
    4. Height
    5. Activity Level
    6. Life Stage
        - Pregnancy
        - Lactation
    7. Health Conditions
        - cronic illnessess, deficiencies, etc.

Calories – Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) + Activity Level:
- Use the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (most common and accurate):

Step 1: Calculate BMR
    - For Men: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age + 5
    - For Women: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age - 161

Step 2: Adjust for Activity Level
    Multiply BMR by an Activity Factor:
      Activity Level	                            Multiplier
        Sedentary (little/no exercise)	                1.2
        Lightly active (light exercise 1–3 days/wk)	    1.375
        Moderately active (3–5 days/wk)	                1.55
        Very active (6–7 days/wk)	                    1.725
        Extra active (hard training or physical job)	1.9

Total Calories = BMR × Activity Factor

Formula:  
    <If user input weight as kg - no change, if user input weight as lbs, need to do conversion to kg>
    kg_conversion = weight_lbs * 0.45359237 (kg)
    Total_Calories_Men = (10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age + 5) x Activity Level
    Total_Calories_Women = (10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age - 161) x Activity Level

Vitamins, Minerals, and Nutrients:
- The Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Values (DV) for nutrients is based on:
    1. Age
    2. Sex
    3. Life Stage (e.g., pregnancy/lactation)

Should store these as a lookup table in database with fileds like:
nutrient_name, age_range, sex, life_stage, recommended_amount, unit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculating Percentage of Daily Intake:
Once you have:
    - The total nutrient amount a person consumed (from the food),
    - Their personalized daily recommended amount,
You calculate:
    percentage = (consumed_amount / recommended_amount) × 100
