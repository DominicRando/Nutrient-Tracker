The lit framework cannot run locally, so you need to create a local "live" version of the website.
Accomplish this using:
    * Live Server VS Code extension
        - Click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner
        - Go to FrontEnd/htmlCode/homePage.htmlCode
    * Create a local server using python (Eventually we will run server on pi)
